# Band tracing in multiband systems

## What is it for?
   Tracing the movement of bands with respect to structural changes such as atom displacements, uni-axial stress/strain, pressure <i>etc</i>.  

## What it is not for?
   It is cannot be used to determine band connectivity.  
   
## Example
   Here is an [example](https://vimeo.com/340742321/4165d7f95d).  
   In the video above, some bands move up and down with B/C movements, while some others remain stationary. The goal of this repository is to automatically compute band deformation with respect to lattice distortions. In essence, automatic deformation extraction is the main goal of this repo.
